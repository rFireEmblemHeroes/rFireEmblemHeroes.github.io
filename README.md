# Flair Selector Website

This website is inteded for use with the Reddit community FireEmblemHeroes. It allows community memebers to choose a custom CSS option (flair) to be displayed next to their username. The website is styled to look like an in-game menu.

The series of 15 buttons at the top filter the options making it easier for a user to find their desired character. To select, a user can click the icon of the character they want, which will open a prefilled Reddit private message form. The form is addressed to the bot account for the subbreddit (Sothis_Bot), with the body containing the CSS class of the chosen flair.

(The seperately hosted bot checks private messages every 6 minutes, and handles the flair assignments)
